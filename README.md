# ft_ssl_md5
OpenSSL is a cryptographic toolkit library written C that is used to secure communications over computer networks. It implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and
Transport Layer Security (TLS) network protocols to protect against eavesdropping
and verify identities during network communication.
You must create a program named ft_ssl that will recreate part of the OpenSSL
functionality. Take care to do it well; the other projects in this series will build directly
onto this program.
For this project, you will implement the md5 and sha256 hashing functions.hashing algorithms.
